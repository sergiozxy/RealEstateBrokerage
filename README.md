# RealEstateBrokerage

**current progress**:

The basic structure is as the follows:

- [x] stylized facts (finished)
- [ ] GMM estimations
- [ ] dynamically estimations of the effect
- [ ] exogeneous or shocking
- [ ] heterogeneous checkings and robustness checkings

## stylized fact:

using two way fixed effect with multple clustering model and the codes have been done.

## GMM estimations

Use dynamic panel data estimation method to deal with small $T$ large $N$ problem serial correlation problem. This method serves as a further check for the stylized result and pave way for our further analysis.

## dynamically estimations of the effect

We dynamically estimate the effect of real estate brokerage's entry and leaving for the local submarket. We conditionally generate the following groups:

TBD.

## exogeneous or shocking

Finally, we consider the exogeneous shock to prove our estimation is asymptotically efficient. Thinking about this problem right now.

## heterogeneous checkings and robustness checkings

easy to manage and leave it alone.
