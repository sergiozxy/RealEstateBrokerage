abstract = {Summary This paper investigates different mechanisms for real estate agents’ influence in housing search. Using residential listing data, I find descriptive evidence suggesting an important role of agents’ influence in the listing stage, during which agents may influence home sellers to set lower initial listing prices. To quantify the impact of this mechanism, I develop a structural model for the home seller's problem particularly in the listing stage, while accounting for other mechanisms. The estimated model shows that agents' influence in the listing stage is consequential, explaining about 60\% of the difference in sales price premiums between agent-owned and client-owned listings.},

Cross section data acquired from NAR’s 2000 Home Buying and Selling Survey is used to conduct the analysis. This study finds that the use of the Internet as a search tool does not reduces buyer search time. Instead, by reducing within-period search costs, it encourages buyers to search more intensively. By making it possible to learn more about the availability of properties on the market, the Internet allows buyers to visit more properties without a commensurate increase in search duration. The implications of these finding with respect to the future role of brokers as market intermediaries are also examined.}

The methodology is applied to popular elections to the House of Representatives, where sorting is neither expected nor found, and to roll call voting in the House, where sorting is both expected and found.}

I present three models of such markets: a monopoly platform; a model of competing platforms where agents join a single platform; and a model of "competitive bottlenecks" where one group joins all platforms. The determinants of equilibrium prices are (i) the magnitude of the cross-group externalities, (ii) whether fees are levied on a lump-sum or per-transaction basis, and (iii) whether agents join one platform or several platforms.},
