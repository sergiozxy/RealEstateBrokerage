I think the primary reason of using TWFE with other method is that the TWFE is the average effect of the results, and the Woodridge (2021) proposed another method to deal with that problem using the proposed MTWFE method. This method is better in identification but our method is good enough to capture this because our results

Furthermore, Bacon decomposition is not applicable in our result, because the Bacon decomposition is only usable in the strongly balanced data and it is not applicable in our highly imbalanced data, and if we drop or imputlate the data the results will definitely changed dramatically (only 20% data is strongly balanced). Therefore, I think if the referee argues that the paper is biased, we'd better use Woodridge paper and probably using their method to prove our correctness.
